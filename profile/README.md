# Welcome to BinOC/Code!

Which is the Github Organization that primarily serves BinOC/Central (not to be confused with binoc-central the old xul repo) and BinOC/Labs.

## Code of Conduct

Try to be reasonably nice and try not to steal things. This is all open source for a reason. Also in regards to branding? One could just *ask* us to think up names and logos that are just as good or better than our own for a new project or fork. You know, just for a change of pace.

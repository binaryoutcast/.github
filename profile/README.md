# Welcome to BinOC/Code!

Which is the Binary Outcast Github Organization that primarily serves BinOC/Central (not to be confused with binoc-central the old xul repo) and BinOC/Labs.

## Resources

Older repositories can be found @ https://github.com/binoc-graveyard/

## Code of Conduct

- Try to be reasonably pleasent and decently nice.
  - False or sickly sweet niceness need not apply.
- Try not to steal things.
  - This is all open source for a reason. If you didn't create it follow the license or simply ask someone preferably the creator.
  - We are good at branding. If you agree, ask us to think up some for your project or fork rather than approperating ours.
- Don't start a war.
  - We will decide which battles to fight and which to ignore.
  - Specifically, MCP-bashing is largely counter-productive. If you don't know what this means or refers to then it doesn't apply to you.
